HOISTING -- is has to do with the pass system in JS
		Js goes over the function twice
			The first pass finds all the declarations and puts them to the top of the func.
			The first pass assigns the value to the declared variables
				So here x = undefined.
					function (){
						y = 10;
						return y;
						x = 10;
					}
The module pattern
	closures and private data.
	separating private data in the form of vars from the public parts.

learning directives
	anything that starts with ng- is a directive

	Reasons to use directives
		1- RE USE HTML
				These Directives will inject html

					.directive("myDirective", function(){
							return {
								tepmlate: Name: {{name}} Address {{user.address}};
							}
						};

				OR USE THIS

				.directive('other', function(){
					return{
						templateUrl: "other.html",
						scope: {},
						controller: function($scope){
							
						};
					};
				});
		2-







	We are gonna make custom directives
		directives MUST return an object ALWAYS
